Note for Claude: don't send chat messages / commentary about this file or its
contents unless explicitly asked — just do the work.
Also, only do one todo at a time. I will test the changes by running the client and dev server myself before you proceed to the next todo.

- Note - P logs position to client console *

# Done

- No lights on day maps
- Shipment Night lights on power + in editor

# Current todo

# Added

- Zombies should move around monkey bomb instead of just standing there
- Create new rampage inducer music
- Add cynder blocks to the level editor for the mystery box to sit on. These will sit at every mystery box location.
- Make hd staminup model
- Make a better blood overlay
- Some objects shouldn't get bullet holes when shot. For instance they don't look right on some perk machines.

# Performance

- When using phd slider a lot on a higher round with a lot of zombies, fps dropped to around 70-90. This seems to just be the case after going through this many rounds instead of starting on a high round from the start.
- Could run btop while game is running
- Could possibly keep a client side graph of entities, effects, fps over time etc

# Flashlight

- Can add a flash light on off sound
- Can turn on flashlight if an area is too dark instead of having it only on when the power is off

# Bugs

- Check: Knife won't stab when enemies are totally point blank
- On zombies if player somehow goes below a certian point or outside of the map bounds they shold be teleported back in. The spawn point shouldn't spawn the player in where they drop down below the map and have to press the teleport button.
- If a zombie is stuck all the way inside of a box it can't escape, add a way for it to be pushed out of it.
- Only one light is coming on when turning on the power
- It doesn't show to update anywhere on the client after it is launched and a new release is out.

# Improve

- Improve molotov fire look
- Dial in phd slider effect look ( trail and explosion )
- Night shipment is a little too dark in shaded areas and can't see remote player model that well

# Adjust

- Increase aim sway

# Big features

- Add semtex
- Add killchains

## Sound

- Level out perk jingle sound volumes
- Add current player death sound. Sound should be a body fall sound mixed with a disonant synth sound.
- Add save teleport sound
- Add mantle sound
- Add footstep sounds for other players
- Possibly convert audio to wav files.
- Add pap shot sounds
- When player is downed a breathing sound should play
